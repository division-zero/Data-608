## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(geojsonsf)
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}


nyc_geo <- geojson_sf(
"/home/georgehagstrom/work/Teaching/DATA608/DataStory4/neighbourhoods.geojson")
nyc_geo |> ggplot(aes(fill= neighbourhood)) +
geom_sf() +
guides(fill = guide_none())

```
